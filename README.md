# Guestara Task

## Description
Guestara is a world-class company aiming to revolutionize the hospitality industry by enhancing experiences for employees, customers, partners, investors, and the community.

## Q.1 : 3 things that you learned from this assignment?
I've gained a solid understanding of handling the hard refresh concept in Vite.js, ensuring a smoother user experience during development. Additionally, I've learned how to efficiently implement hooks in complex components, where without using libraries, it would have been a lot more challenging. This approach has significantly improved my ability to manage state and side effects within React components.

## Q.2 : What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
The toughest part of this project was working with the scroll event without the Mobiscroll library, especially when managing multiple events. I also ran into issues when trying to integrate a UI library, as it clashed with both the existing CSS library and some internal styles. I ended up doing some research and asking for help to figure out how to handle these challenges.

## Q.3 : What would you have done differently given more time?


If I had more time, I would have worked on making the components more reusable, removing hardcoded values, and ensuring they were mobile-responsive. This would have helped improve the overall flexibility and scalability of the project.
